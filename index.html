            An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. 
            An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger.
            IDEs are designed to maximize programmer productivity by providing tight-knit components with similar user interfaces.    
            One aim of the IDE is to reduce the configuration necessary to piece together multiple development utilities, instead it provides the same set of capabilities as one cohesive unit.
            Reducing setup time can increase developer productivity, especially in cases where learning to use the IDE is faster than manually integrating and learning all of the individual tools.

            <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>- Our conlusion here is based on the information provided and it highlights the pros and cons of the above IDEs.
            <p>- VS code will be seleceted as the best to use as a beginner.
            <p>- VS code can be downloaded here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
            <p>- Visual Studio Code could be very useful for those who are new in programming as it can be used as an excellent learning tool which explains you everything right from the simple HTML tag to syntax and error handling in programming.
            <p>-Cons: Being based in Electron, VS Code may be slow to start (depending on the loaded plugins) or be slow with big files. Takes up a lot of memory.
